                <div class="bold">What is emotional intelligence?</div>
                <p>When you see your friend crying and you are able to feel or understand that, they are sad means you are understanding the emotion. You are expressing your concern by saying I'm here for you and comforting them by giving a hug is empathy. The ability to perceive and manage your emotions or feelings and help people around you to make them feel better by expressing your concern is emotional intelligence.

                <div class="bold">How is EQ different from IQ?</div>
                <p>IQ is the brain's ability to learn and solve problems. EQ, on the other hand, is about understanding how you feel and managing or taking care of those feelings. So, IQ is about being smart, while EQ is about being kind and understanding.

                <div class="bold">Why is EQ important?</div>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is important for several reasons. When you manage your emotions and those around you, it will help in establishing better and stronger relationships. Identifying and regulating your emotions will help in stress management. Having high EQ helps in both career and personal well being, as understanding and managing your emotions will allow you to think rationally and calmly to handle the challenges and also helps in solving conflicts successfully by better communication.
