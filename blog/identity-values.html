                               Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

                               <p>In my previous role at a paint manufacturing plant, I frequently analyzed samples in our lab to ensure quality. One particular sample required color matching due to an initial error from makers side. I successfully matched the color by adding the appropriate pigment. However, when the factory added the upscaled quantity I provided, the final color was incorrect.
                                </p>
                                <p>Upon reviewing my work, I discovered a decimal error in my calculations. I had intended to add 0.5 kilograms of the pigment for a 1000-kilogram batch but mistakenly sent out 5 kilograms. This oversight could have been prevented by double-checking my calculations. So I sat back and reflected on whats the best thing to do while others were finding it hard on how this happened thinking it was fault from makers side. Then I walked up to my boss with some fear in my mind and told him what had happened honestly and it was my mistake. My boss then smiled instead of being disappointed and just told me not to repeat this again and he took care of further escalations. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The decision I made was being honest and I realized it is priceless and people respect you for it. I will continue to be honest as I was previously and I will keep asking myself  “am I doing the right thing?”

                                    <p>My culture taught me family comes first, there is no greater asset than humanity. It also taught me kindness and care have been a way of life and way forward. It has also taught me honesty, importance of education, respecting everyone equally and your anger is your enemy.

                                <p> I also learnt from my parents, that you need to work hard for what you want and never assume things will happen without an effort.

                                <p>The VIA Institute's character personality test identified honesty as my top strength. This will be beneficial throughout my learning journey. When I encounter difficulties, I will seek help rather than struggling alone. This approach will foster trust with my team and instructors and help me overcome obstacles.

                                 <p>I also used the Think 2 Perform app to identify values that resonate with me. The most important values I discovered are family, honesty, education, relationships, and work.

                                <p>In my previous role at a paint manufacturing plant, I frequently collaborated with various teams, which sometimes led to differing opinions. One instance involved a missing raw material in the initial sample provided to the lab. Despite testing not revealing any obvious issues, I suspected a problem with the paint. When the paint was applied to a wall, it sagged, indicating a quality issue. Additionally, a yield calculation revealed a lower-than-expected volume. I consulted with the maker to understand the process and discovered a missing thickener that prevents sagging. Initially, he blamed the technical team for providing an incorrect formula. Through patient discussion, we resolved the issue.
