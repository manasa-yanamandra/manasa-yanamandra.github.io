                        <p>Strengths - I’m hardworking, never give up on what I started. If I don’t know something I don't hesitate to seek help/guidance.</p>
                        <p>Limitations - Coding is a new language which i’m learning, so, it’s taking time for me to understand concepts and implement those concepts in practice.</p>

                        <p>I decided to leave my job to fully concentrate on this learning opportunity. I'll do my best to minimize distractions and ensure productive learning. I'm committed to effective communication with my peers and facilitators, aiming for a seamless and collaborative environment. I'll actively listen to others and communicate clearly and respectfully. If conflicts arise, I'll strive to resolve them peacefully through teamwork and compromise.</p>

                        <p>I'll do my best to avoid feeling overwhelmed by pressure. While I know it can be challenging at times, I'll take breaks to manage stress. I'll also prioritize the most important tasks and focus on completing them. I'll seek support from family and friends when i need it. Additionally, I'll break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable ones and set realistic goals. Finally, I'll avoid committing to additional responsibilities if I'm already feeling overwhelmed.</p>

                        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
                        </div>
                        <p>I’m completely committed to my learning during these four months so there are no block-out times. My family is ensuring that the only thing I do is keep learning.</p>
