                                        <p>The most surprising thing I've learned about human skills was how much they connect to programming. I didn't realize that soft skills like empathy and communication are just as important as technical skills when making good software.
                                        </p>

                              <p>Overcoming my own ego and biases was the most challenging aspect. It's not always easy to admit my mistakes or be open to feedback. However, I've learned that these challenges are essential for growth and improvement.

                                  Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
                                </div>
                                        <p>Focusing on human skills is essential for a successful developer. While technical skills are important, being able to work well with others, understand user needs, and communicate clearly is just as crucial. It helps you collaborate effectively in teams and create products that people actually want to use.

                                  Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

                                        <p>No, the time spent studying Human Skills learning was not a waste. In fact, I believe it was a valuable investment. While technical skills are essential, soft skills are equally important for success in the programming field. These skills will help me build stronger relationships, communicate more effectively, and become a more valuable team member.
