                            <p><span class="bold-word">Problem:</span> I was using an if/else statement to check if a number is divisible by 3, but I wasn't familiar with how to use the remainder operator effectively within the condition.

                                    <p><span class="bold-word">Research:</span> I looked into different resources like the handbook and Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) to understand the remainder operator (%). The documentation helped me break down the expression if (i % 3 === 0).
                                    </p>

                            <h3>Super FlipFlop Challenge</h3>
                            <p><span class="bold-word">Problem:</span> I needed to write code that iterates through a list of numbers and creates a new array containing strings like "Flip," "Flop," or "FlipFlop" based on divisibility rules. Numbers divisible by 3 would be mapped to "Flip," those divisible by 5 to "Flop," and those divisible by both 3 and 5 to "FlipFlop." The challenge lay in implementing the logic to add these corresponding strings to the new array.
                            </p>
                            <p><span class="bold-word">Techniques:</span></p>

                                <li>
                                    <p><span class="bold-word">Understanding Loops:</span>  I reviewed the concept of for loops, which allow iterating through a list of elements and executing code for each element.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><span class="bold-word">Identifying the Right Method:</span>  I explored different ways to add elements to an array and realized the push() method was the most appropriate solution.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                            <p><span class="bold-word">Solution with Push Method:</span>   I referred to my understanding of for loops and the push() method to write the code that iterates through the original array. Inside the loop, I used conditional statements to check if a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. Depending on the divisibility, I used push() to add the corresponding string ("Flip," "Flop," or "FlipFlop") to the new array.
                            </p>
                            <p><span class="bold-word">Feelings:</span> Initially, I felt frustrated because I was struggling to integrate the push() method correctly. However, by reviewing loop concepts and analyzing error messages in the test code, I eventually figured out the syntax and logic. This led to a sense of accomplishment when the code worked as intended.
                            </p>
                            <p><span class="bold-word">Lesson Learned:</span>  This challenge emphasized the importance of understanding both control flow structures (like for loops) and built-in array methods (like push()). Combining these concepts allows for efficient manipulation of data within arrays. Additionally, analyzing error messages provides valuable insights into syntax errors and logic issues.

Next time, I'll reach out for help sooner instead of spending a lot of time struggling alone.
