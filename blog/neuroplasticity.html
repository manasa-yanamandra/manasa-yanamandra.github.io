                            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
                            <p>Neuroplasticity is essentially molding the brain through repetition or practice. The more you repeat the task the easier it becomes for you remember. For example it is hard to remember the names of people you just met but it is easier to remember the names of loved ones you haven’t seen in a decade.</p>
                      
                                <div class="bold">

                                 How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:
                            </div> 
                             
                                <p>Neuroplasticity helps people with disabilities to achieve specific tasks through repetition and practice.</p>
                                <p>Motivates them to learn new things as they know that they are fully capable of building knowledge and changing their brains.</p>

                            
                            
                                <div class="bold">
                                   Engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit:
                                </div>
                                    <p>Neuroplasticity can help me benefit by achieving my goals through repetition and practice.
                                </p> 
                                <p>It is clear that if we don’t use something for a long period of time we will forget it.
                                </p>
                                <p>It also tells us that experience from the plasticity of one skill can help acquire and enhance similar skills. </p>
                                <p>Repeatedly practicing and reviewing will help me in storing the knowledge in my brain otherwise it will fade and weaken overtime.</p>
                                <p>Using the skill set learned from one situation and applying it to the other.</p>

                                <p>Repeated practicing one skill to strengthen memory i.e., connection of the existing neural pathway.</p>
                                <p>Putting the information into context in a way that even a kid can understand.</p>
                                <p>Constantly reminding yourself that anything is achievable through repetition or practice.</p>

                                <p>I believe that with effort, determination, and focus, we can achieve any goal. Small, steady steps are often more helpful than trying to do too much at once.</p>
                                <p>To overcome obstacles, it's important to be honest about our weaknesses and work on improving them.</p>
                                <p>As a new programmer, I know that success comes from learning and understanding.</p>                     
                                <p>I believe that skills are something we can build, not something we're born with. Many successful people have achieved their goals through hard work and dedication.</p>
                            
                                <div class="bold">

                                <p>With the right approach and handwork anything can be achievable. </p>
                                <p>We are in control of our abilities and they can be built. Biggest change is not shying away from learning new things and with a positive attitude.</p>

                            <h3>Learning plan and strategies:</h3>
                            <p>Blending your learning plan and strategies means making sure they fit together well. It’s like putting together the pieces of a puzzle to create a complete picture. Reflecting on how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy is like looking at the puzzle and thinking about how the pieces fit together and what they mean. It’s about understanding how neuroplasticity and growth mindset can help you learn better.</p>  
                            <p>I am aligning to develop a more “can do” attitude. I somehow have an increased level of curiosity to ask more questions and try more hands on when it comes to coding. I know the growth mindset is an ocean and my effort is just a teardrop but someday I will ensure that I am  more than 80% of that ocean. It’s easier said than done when it comes to progressing at life, work but in order to get to the done phase I will try to invest a lot of uplifting thought process and self motivation in this journey. I will keep learning more and more and I'll try to improve my continuous learning so that I can learn more.</p>  
                              <p>I have been exposed to continuous usage of git commands which in a way i believe is a repeated practice. I will continue to do that. I will try to do more git commands down the line.</p>
                              <p>I have already been doing a lot of html stuff so far which in a way is also a continuous practice process too. I will practice html, css and javascript on my own once I have the capacity to do so.</p>

                                Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences my learning:

                            <p></p>
                            
                            <p><span class="bold-word">Neuroplasticity</span> is like a magic trick for your brain. It means your brain can change and grow, even as you get older. It's like building new muscles – the more you use your brain, the stronger it gets.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold-word">Growth mindset</span> is like believing you can learn and improve, no matter how hard things get. It’s like thinking, “I can do this!” even when it’s tough.</p>
                            <p>Together, neuroplasticity and growth mindset are a powerful combination. They help you learn new things, overcome challenges, and reach your goals.</p>
                              <div class="bold">
                                    Example:
                                </div>
                                <p></p>
                               
                                <p><span class="bold-word">Neuroplasticity</span> is like planting new seeds in the garden. It means your brain can grow and learn new things, just like a garden can grow new flowers.</p>
                         
                                <p><span class="bold-word">Growth mindset</span> is like believing you can make your garden grow bigger and more beautiful, no matter how small it is now.</p>
                                <div class="bold">
                                    Together, neuroplasticity and growth mindset can help you learn like a gardener:
                                 </div>
                                 <ol>
                                    <li>Plant new seeds: Try new things and challenge yourself.</li>
                                    <li>Tend to your garden: Practice regularly and don't give up.</li>
                                    <li>Believe in your garden: Have confidence that you can grow and learn.</li>
                                 </ol>
                                <p>By using these tools, you can make your learning journey a success!</p>
