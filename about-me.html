            <p>My name is Manasa Priyanka Yanamandra but i preferred to be called Manasa. Originally from India, I moved to New Zealand at 17 to join my parents and I currently reside in Auckland.</p>
            <p>I earned a degree in Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering from Massey University. After graduation, I worked as a Quality Control Technician in a paint manufacturing company for two years. While I enjoyed my work, I felt limited growth opportunities and found the physical demands and exposure to chemicals challenging.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the software engineers in my family, I decided to pursue a career in programming. With their support, I began to understand the fundamentals of coding and its real-world applications. Watching them work on their personal projects fascinated me.</p>
            <p>I enrolled in Dev Academy to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to transition into a successful software engineer, while I understand the road to become an experienced software engineer is not easy, I believe the training and team work that I get exposed to in this program will definitely help me accomplish my goal. I'm excited to work with yaâ€™ll!</p>
